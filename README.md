# Resignation Dashboard
Intern Project @ KPMG
Developed a Hardware-Returning Software using PyQt and the functions are as following: 
- Reading all hardware products in the back-end database under the employee's name and displaying them in a structured table.
- Using the computer camera to scan the QR code or the Bar code on the hardware to modify the status in the database and record the hardware as successfully returned.
